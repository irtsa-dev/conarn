</p>
<p align="center">
    <b>Conarn</b> utilizes <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.12/Lib/tkinter/__init__.py">Tkinter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter">CustomTkinter</a> for the GUI along with <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller">pyinstaller</a> to package as an executable.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Usage
Depending on if you downloaded the source code directly or the executable, you will run **conarn.pyw** or **conarn.exe** respectively. Once ran, it will recognize any current saves where **Content Warning** save files are stored. 
<br />
<br />
*(This is typically at C:/Users/[USERNAME]/AppData/LocalLow/Landfall Games/Content Warning/Saves which is where it will check)*
<br />
<br />
<br />
It will display any found files for you to edit.
